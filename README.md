# Proton
A scalable platform for multimedia installations
***
 
Proton aims to make it easier for digital artists to create immersive works that
utilize lighting, graphics, sounds, and interactive elements. It is designed with
scale in mind, enabling works to grow from a single Arduino board to building-scale
networks of interlinked components. With its core written in Rust, Proton aims to
deliver fast rendering and low latency -- which is particularly important when
synchronizing effects to music.

Proton is just a hobby project (for now?) and currently does not work at all.
